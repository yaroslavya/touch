**Touch**
=====

**Touch** provides additional bindings to handle touch events in [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com). 
All touch events heavylifting is done by [hammer](http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/).

Below are some code examples on how you can use touch to handle some touch events:

```<div id="touchme" data-bind="tap:tapHandler"></div>```

Now everytime you tap the div tapHandler will be called. You can find a better demo inside SimpleDemo.html
which is a part of touch. Actually it's just a converted example from hammer. But it will let you see
the difference between using touch and not using touch.

More examples are on their way!
